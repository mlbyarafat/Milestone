  <h1>Building a Website</h1>
  <p>My personal journey into front-end and back-end web development.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>I started with HTML and CSS, learning how to structure and style simple pages.</p>

  <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
  <p>Once I understood the basics, I moved to JavaScript to make my websites interactive.</p>

  <h2>Going Full Stack</h2>
  <p>Later, I explored Python Flask and databases to build dynamic web applications.</p>
